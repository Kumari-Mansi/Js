# Notes for oops concepts in JavaScript

# JavaScript and classses
Js is a prototype-based language
Yes, JavaScript has classes. Introduced in ES6 (2015), classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over its prototype-based inheritance. They make it easier to create objects and handle inheritance. A class can have constructors, methods, and can extend other classes, making object-oriented programming (OOP) more readable and structured in JavaScript.

## OOPS
Programming paradigms
OOP makes code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain by thinking in terms of real-world objects.


## Objects
- Collection of properties and methods
- toLowercase
- new keyword is used

## Why do we use oops concepts
We use programming paradigms to organize code better, solve problems more efficiently, improve readability, make maintenance easier, and handle complexity smartly.


## parts of OOPs
Object Literal

## Keywords
- Constructors function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances(new,this)

## 4 Pillars
Abstraction -> hide details (fetch)
Enacpsulation -> wrapup data
Inheritance 
Polymorphism -> many (console.log())
