JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT

{} => Global Execution Context (referred by this)
Exection context slightly differs in node js environment and browser
in browser this value is window object

JAVASCRIPT is a single threaded

1. Global Execution Context
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context (Property of global object)

how code runs
{code} 
1.Memory creation phase (space or memory is allocated to the variable declaration)
2.Execution phase

code sample
let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
Function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total = num1+num2
    return total
}
let result1=addNum(val1,val2)
let result2=addNum(10,2)

1.global Exection=>this

2.Memory phase
val1=>undefined
val2=>undefined
addNum=>definitation
result1=>undefined
result2=>undefined

3.Execution phase
val1=>10
val2=>5
addNum=>new variable environment + Exection thread

under this:

1.Memory phase
val1=>undefined
val2=>undefined
total=>undefined

2.Execution context
num1=>10
num2=>5
total=>15 //return to global Exection context
once the work is completed you can delete the global Exection context
